    <h1>Biography</h1>
      <p>Hi there! My name is Tyson, I'm 30 years old and grew up in Portland, OR. I bounced around during my undergraduate degree, allowing me to live in Washington and Idaho. While in Idaho I met my wife and we got married in 2018. We moved to Austin, TX where I completed my Doctorate degree in Physical Therapy at the University of St. Augustine for Health Sciences in 2021. Since, I've been practicing as a Doctor of Physical Therapy, primarily in outpatient orthopedics. Currently, I'm in the process of changing careers into the technology industry. At this time, I'm interested in full stack development, cloud engineering, and machine learning. My goal is to start as an entry level software engineer by Fall of 2024.</p>
